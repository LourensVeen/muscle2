Requirements:

  CMAKE
  Boost >= 1.35

Build - typical cmake build:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make

Config:

  In file config.cfg (file name can be changed in options.h) or via args.
  Example file dumped below:

    localPortLow   = 10002
    localPortHigh  = 19999
    remotePortLow  = 20002
    remotePortHigh = 29999
    myAddress      = localhost
    myPort         = 10000
    indoorPort     = 10001
    indoorAddress  = 0.0.0.0
    peerAddress    = localhost
    peerPort       = 20000
    
Client communication:

  For details, see messages.(h|cpp)

  REQUEST:

    T|S S S S|s s|D D D D|d d|I I I I

    T type (1b)
      S source address (4b)
              s source port (2b)
                  D destination address (4b)
                          d desination port (2b)
                              IIII some session id (unused)
  
  RESPONSE:

    REQUEST | R R R R
  
    REQUEST as above
              R response

  Type:
    
    1 - register listening port
    2 - connect
    3 - response to connect

  Source and dest adresses are written in network format (127.0.0.0 will be written as 0x01 0x00 0x00 0x7f)
  Ports, tye and length are written in 'normal' big-endian (most significant byte first) notation (port 22 is 0x00 0x16) 


  1) BIND
  
    Client sends a request with type 1 and src adress/port to the MTO and closes.

  2) Connect

    Client sends a request with type 2 and src/dest address/port to the MTO.
    Client waits for the response. If response is 0, the connect succeeded.
     ( If the response is non-zero (i.e. 1), the connection failed and MTO closes the connection )
    Client exchanes data with peer normally.


Building user space boost & building with boost

  If no boost or only boost < 1.35 is available, one needs to:

  Download boost (from http://www.boost.org/users/download/ )
  Unpack and run:

    ./bootstrap.sh --with-libraries=system,program_options   # this will set up only the required part
    ./b2   # this will build boost

  To use the boost with CMAKE, one has to run 

    BOOST_ROOT=/path/to/unpacked/boost cmake ..

  To run the app, copy the libs from  './stage/lib' to the folder with MTO executables.
