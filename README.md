MUSCLE 2.0
==========

The multiscale coupling library and environment 2 (MUSCLE 2) computes multiscale
models on local or distributed hardware. It is maintained and documented at
its [PSNC repository][1]. It is a fork of MUSCLE developed in the
[EU COAST project][2], that generalizes the original functionality as
required in [EU MAPPER project][3]. As far as we know the original repository
is no longer available.

MUSCLE 2 is designed to work on multiple Linux flavours and on Mac OS X.
For installation instructions and usage, see the [MUSCLE 2 wiki][4].
